My Husband and I took a little day trip to NYC, here's what we did. 

### Museum of Natural History

First stop: **American Museum of Natural History**. It was my first time here, I really enjoyed the fossils, mammal dioramas, and the ocean life exibits.

One of my favorite things I learned about was the Rafflesia, which I saw a sculpture of in the Hall of Biodiversity. It stood out to me because in **Animal Crossing**, if you get the "worst" rating, a large red flower spawns on the ground and it looked eerily similar to that one, so I had to find out its name. Rafflesia, aka "Stinking Corpse Lily".

We spent hours at the museuem but I would love to go back and explore more. Next time, I would love to check out the mineral exhibits.

### Obligatory Sweet Treat

After the museum, we had to get a sweet treat at **Salt and Straw**.

Strawberry Tres Leches and Salted, Malted, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, respectively.

### Central Park Walk

After our sweet treat, we took a walk through **Central Park**. It was nice and quiet, a much needed break from the busy city streets. I saw so many turtles and a really nice view of the skyline.

### Shopping Haul

After the trek through central park from the upper west side, we got to do some shopping in mid-manhattan.
Places we stopped at: **UNIQLO, Book off, Kinokunyia.**

I don't have a UNIQLO local to me, unfortunately, so I wanted to take advantage of the NYC location. It was *huge*, so much larger than expected. My husband and I both picked up a few things. I stepped out of my comfort zone a bit and bought a dark green dress instead of black. Crazy!

Book off was definitely a favorite for me. We rifled through their used CDs and figures for a long time. I was on the hunt for [this specific CD](https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_WAVE_02_Chrono-Lexica) but got a bit unlucky.
